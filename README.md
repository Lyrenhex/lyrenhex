# Hey ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / they

I'm a software developer at [Arm](https://arm.com) and an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of York. You're welcome to read more about my professional work <a href="https://mheaton.dev">at mheaton.dev</a>. Otherwise...

## Personal projects

You *might* know me from some of the projects I maintain:

- [twedia](https://github.com/Lyrenhex/twedia), a music management solution for Twitch streamers ([why?](https://lyrenhex.com));
- [eos](https://eos.lyrenhex.com), a progressive web application (PWA) to help track mental health and provide resources;
- [the covid19-uk-rs library](https://crates.io/crates/covid19_uk_rs) to interact with the 'Coronavirus in the UK' dataset using Rust bindings;
- or others! I have plenty more archived projects that I worked on and learned from. âš¡

Other than maintaining existing projects, most of my work at the moment is likely to be for university or <a href="https://github.com/dheaton-arm">open-source work in Arm</a>.

*(Your friendly reminder that any opinions are my own. Cheers!)*
